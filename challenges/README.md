# Transportation Hackathon 2023
The touchstone repository for the inaugural 2023 Transportation Hackathon in Northeastern CT!

This is the root directory for all six challenges. Challenge specific data, documents, and images can be found under the in a subdirectory with the same name as that challenge. Cloning this repository will give you local copies of all source and data files for all challenges that are not available on hard drives at the event (see organizers at the event for details).

See the [**wiki Challenge page**](https://github.com/HackCTorg/Transportation-Hackathon-2023/wiki/Challenges) for more details about the challenges.

Hackathon project repositories will eventually appear on the [Transportation-Hackathon-2023 organization page](https://github.com/Transportation-Hackathon-2023)
