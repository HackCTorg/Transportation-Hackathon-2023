# Judgesâ€™ Rubric / Judging Criteria

##  0. Judging Instructions

As a judge, you should consider each of the criteria below when evaluating a project. Do this by asking yourself the questions below while watching project demonstrations. You will determine a score in each of the criteria ranging between 1 and 5 points; total scores for judged projects will range from 5 to 25. You will use this scoring to rank your top three projects, and you may use your discretion on ties. Judges may then commonly agree upon the three leading projects which they have ranked highly, and judges may continue further discussion among themselves when no clear winners are apparent.

## On a scale from 1 to 5, is this solution...

##  1. Practical?

This is the measure of how suitable a project solution is for a particular challenge, and how useful it can be when put into effect. When considering how practical a project solution is, ask yourself these questions:

* Is this a feasible solution that can be deployed near term?
* Will this solution work for all stakeholders? Will people want to use it?
* Are the technologies used in the solution readily available and open source?

##  2. Impactful?

This criteria scores how powerful of an effect the project solution will have on the people or on the situation related to a challenge. When considering how impactful a project solution is, ask yourself these questions:

* Will this solution be effective for a significant amount of the populace?
* What are the positive outcomes for people who use this solution?
* Environmental
 
##  3. Data-driven?



* Does the solution demonstrably overcome a challenge using real world data?
* Are the data sources regularly maintained and refreshed, of good quality, official?

##  4. Scalable?

The consideration for this criteria is to score how well a project solution will be able to grow or to be adapted to meeting greater needs for the people affected by the challenge or otherwise how it will remain effective when the situation gets worse or more complicated.  When determining the scalability score, ask yourself these questions:

* Can this solution be expanded or upgraded over time, or can it be easily extended into larger areas?
* Will this solution work for growing populations?

##  5. Fundable?

The score for this criteria should reflect the opinion of the judge 

* Does it align to any existing infrastructure bill/grant funding?
* Where are there gaps in funding?
* Does it have a local/state champion?
* Is it possible to combine funding from various organizations
