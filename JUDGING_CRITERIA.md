# Judges’ Rubric / Judging Criteria

##  0. Judging Instructions

As a judge, you should consider each of the criteria below when evaluating a project. Do this by asking yourself the questions below while watching project demonstrations. You will determine a score in each of the criteria ranging between 1 and 5 points; total scores for judged projects will range from 5 to 25. You will use this scoring to rank your top three projects, and you may use your discretion on ties. Judges may then commonly agree upon the three leading projects which they have ranked highly, and judges may continue further discussion among themselves when no clear winners are apparent.
