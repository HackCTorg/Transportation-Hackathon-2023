# HackCT - Transportation Hackathon 2023 Code of Conduct

## 0. Following the Rules

By participating in this HackCT event, you agree to comply with this Code of Conduct, the Acceptable Use Policy of the venue (which you may read upon connecting to the venue wireless network), venue policies and procedures regarding the safety and security of its visitors, guests, facilities and collections, and the directions of venue staff and volunteers while you are at the event. Participants who do not comply with any of the above may be asked to leave the event and may be prohibited from participating in similar future events at the venue or with HackCT.

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of the HackCT event is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in this hackathon to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Application Process and Corporate Member Participation

All applications for the hackathon will be reviewed and individual participants from the general public will be selected based upon the information submitted through their application form. Official corporate teams representing corporate members are chosen via their own selection processes.

People who work for invited corporate members and are not officially part of invited corporate member teams may apply as individual participants from the general public, but are not guaranteed entry. Employees of corporate members must check with their own corporate liaison to determine what other rules or restrictions from their employer they must follow with regard to the hackathon.

## 3. Open Source Citizenship and Participants' Creations

The mission of this HackCT event is to make a change in Northeastern Connecticut’s access to transportation resources; re-think how we understand, invest in, and leverage our local transportation resources; and support regional collaboration in order to access state and federal opportunities - ultimately driving new open source transit solutions for Eastern CT residents.

The projects created by hackathon participants will use publicly-available datasets and other open-source resources. Participants agree to publish all works created at this hackathon in publicly-available databases or websites and to permit others to access and use these works on a royalty-free, open source, non-commercial basis. If you wish to make commercially-viable solutions, please consider attending another event. Participants additionally agree not to disrupt other participants' work at this hackathon, or use content being created by other participants without express consent.

You agree that any original work you create is freely available without restriction or is licensed as open source as defined by the [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd). If you do not specify a specific OSI compliant license in your repository, your works will be considered released under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 4. Filming and Photography

This HackCT event may be filmed or photographed by HackCT and the non-profit organizations it represents for non-profit educational and fundraising purposes including promoting other events and public programs produced by any of the affiliated non-profits, in any form of media, anywhere. In addition, invited members of the press may be present at the event and may also film or photograph the event and the participants. By participating in this HackCT event, you agree to be filmed or photographed for these purposes, as also indicated on the accompanying release forms.
